<Callout color="info" title="Conveying meaning to assistive technologies">
  Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to
  users of assistive technologies â€“ such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the
  color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through
  alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the `.visually-hidden` class.
</Callout>

## Customizing

### CSS variables

React callouts use local CSS variables on `.callout` for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.

<ScssDocs file="_callout.scss" capture="callout-css-vars"/>

#### How to use CSS variables

```jsx
const vars = { 
  '--my-css-var': 10,
  '--my-another-css-var': "red" 
}
return <CCallout style={vars}>...</CCallout>
```

### SASS variables
